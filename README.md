The code can be run on any python ide.
I have used pandas numpy and seaborn for data visualizations
After data visualization I found yhta the data was highly correlated so to reduse the dimentionality I used seaborn's pairplot to find the most correlated data and drop them
We can also use PCA to reduce the dimentionality
Then I used Normalizer to ormalize data 
The model used was svm
